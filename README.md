# MediCare - Hospital Management Syste

MediCare is a comprehensive hospital management system that streamlines appointment scheduling, patient management, and doctor registration. The system includes a user-friendly front end, a dynamic dashboard, and a back end that handles user authentication and data management securely.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure login and sign-up for both patients and doctors.
- **Appointment Management**: Patients can schedule and manage their appointments with doctors.
- **Dashboard**: Dynamic dashboard displaying user information, appointments, and doctor details.
- **Doctor Registration**: Doctors can register and manage their profiles, making it easy for patients to book consultations.
- **Real-time Notifications**: Receive real-time updates on appointment status and messages.

## Languages Used

- **JavaScript**: Core language for both the front-end (React) and back-end (Node.js, Express).
- **HTML/CSS**: Structure and styling of the web pages.
- **MongoDB Query Language**: For database queries and data management.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: Backend server
- **Express.js**: Routing and middleware
- **MongoDB**: Database for storing user and appointment data
- **JWT**: Secure user authentication
- **React.js**: Front-end for user interface
- **Cloudinary**: Image upload and management for profiles
- **CSS**: Styling for the front-end

## Problem Solving

During development, I tackled several challenges, including:

- **Authentication & Authorization**: Implemented secure login and registration using JWT and bcrypt for hashing passwords.
- **Data Integrity**: Ensured consistent data flow between the front end and back end, and resolved issues with real-time appointment status updates.
- **Dashboard Design**: Developed a dynamic and interactive dashboard that updates with real-time user data.

## Future Improvements

- **Notification System**: Adding email or SMS notifications for patients.
- **Doctor Availability Tracking**: Enhance scheduling by integrating real-time doctor availability.
